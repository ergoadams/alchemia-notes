            To the Reader,
There is no more holy and noble purfuit
than that of alchemy, to ftudy His grand
creation and marvel at its wondrous
beauty. Our fociety is forever indebted to the
work of fages paft, for without them we would
have no bricks or glass, no ink or aper, no
beer or wine, no falts or metals and no
adequate medicines.

The goal of all good and holy alchemifts fhould
be to aid the poor through chryfopeia and heal
the fick though chemiatria, however fome
would feek to use this great knowledge for their
own wicked means. To that end I write my
instructions as plainly as I dare, to illuminate
for the adept but make a fool of the unjuft.
